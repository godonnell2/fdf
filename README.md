fdf: Wireframes So Good, They're Almost 3D! (But Not Quite)
Welcome to fdf, your one-stop shop for rendering glorious, albeit slightly flat, wireframe models. Ever dreamt of seeing your data points connect in a beautiful, albeit pixelated, dance? Well, dream no more! fdf is here to make those dreams… two-dimensional.

What is this sorcery?!
fdf (stands for Fun Data Frames? Fabulous Drawing Functions? We'll let you decide, but it's probably just "Fil De Fer," which is French for "wireframe" – boring, we know) takes a simple numerical map and transforms it into a stunning (to us, anyway) isometric projection. Think of it as a low-budget, retro-cool way to visualize terrain, or perhaps the architectural plans for a house built exclusively out of spaghetti.

Features (or, "What can it do besides look vaguely 3D?")
Reads .fdf files: Because where else would you get your data for wireframes? From thin air? Don't be ridiculous.

Isometric Projection: Makes everything look fancy and angled, even if it's just a bunch of numbers. Your flat data will finally have some perspective!

Adjustable Zoom: Too close for comfort? Too far to see the pixelated glory? Zoom in and out like a pro! Just don't expect it to resolve into a high-definition IMAX experience.

Color Me Impressed (or not): We've got colors! Because even wireframes deserve to be vibrant.

Height Scaling: Make those mountains really pop! Or, make them look like speed bumps. Your call, visionary.

Getting Started (The "How Do I Make It Do The Thing?" Section)
Clone this repo:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/fdf.git
(Replace your-username with your actual username, unless you are "your-username," in which case, well played.)

Compile the magic:

Bash

make
This incantation will summon the executable fdf from the ether.

Run it with your map:

Bash

./fdf maps/42.fdf
Replace maps/42.fdf with your own .fdf file. Just make sure it's a grid of numbers, separated by spaces. Don't try to feed it your grocery list; fdf is particular.

Example .fdf file (because we're not monsters):
0 0 0 0 0
0 5 10 5 0
0 10 20 10 0
0 5 10 5 0
0 0 0 0 0
This will create a magnificent wireframe pyramid. Or maybe a very spiky hill. Depends on your interpretation.

Controls (Because Mice and Keyboards Are a Thing)
Move: Arrow keys ( ↑ ↓ ← → ) - Wiggle your wireframe around the screen.

Zoom: + / - - Get up close and personal, or take a step back.

Rotate: W A S D (X-axis), Q E (Y-axis), Z C (Z-axis) - Spin it like you just don't care!

Height: [ / ] - Make those peaks taller or shorter. Sculpt your digital landscape!

Projection: I (Isometric), P (Parallel) - Switch between fancy 3D-ish and "just the facts, ma'am" views.

Reset: R - Messed it all up? Hit R to start fresh. Like a digital "undo" button for your life choices.

Exit: ESC - Had enough wireframe fun for one day? Press escape to return to reality (where things often have more than two dimensions).

Contributing (If You Dare)
